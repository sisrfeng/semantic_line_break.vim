1. 我是前半句, 我是后半句.
If you do enough work in any sort of free software environment, you get used to
doing lots of writing of documentation or all sorts of other things in some
plaintext system which exports to some non-plaintext system.  One way or
another you have to decide: are you going to wrap your lines with newlines?
And of course the answer should be "yes" because lines that trail all the way
off the edge of your terminal is a sin against the plaintext gods, who are
deceptively mighty, and whose wrath is to be feared (and blessings to be
embraced).  So okay, of course one line per paragraph is off the table.  So
what do you do?
